# [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

The Dream: "Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React"

- [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Learn the Basics](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html)

## Points of Exploration

### [Hot Reloading](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html)

Instead of recompiling, reload the app instantly while retaining the application's state.

### Native Code (as necessary)

React Native combines smoothly with native components in Objective-C, Java or Swift in order to optimize aspects of an application. 

## Project Setup

Using `react-native-cli` you can create a new React Native project using `react-native init <Project Name>`.

- Ensure that you have the Java8 JDK installed, this can be verified by running `java -version`, if the version is less than 8, or if you are missing a JDK altogether, then you can install it using homebrew:
  - `brew cask install caskroom/versions/java8`
-
