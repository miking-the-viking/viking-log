# Viking DevLog

My devlog. What big thing did I learn today, remember, etc.


### Monday March 26 2018 8PM

I've recently been attempting to focus on refining my development experience and levelling up my skills. Installing new tools like PHP CS Fixer, finally getting PHPCS to work, TDD and mocking calls, experimenting with a few linters and a whole wack of VS Code plugins (Slack integration!).

In this self-retro I realized that I should start a record of my learning experience as as developer to at least make jot notes of the key ideas (so hopefully they're easier to remember, or can help somebody else out). I've already tragically missed something like 9-10 years of that experience considering I never tried developing before until my first day of University. I do not expect I'll maintain a very _frequent_ status update, but will try to post anything notable as frequently as can be done.


#### Today I:
- created this viking-log repo and started trying to oganized the readme (`/docs/`) folder as the topics likely deserve their own page
- installed [`Insert Date String`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring) vs-code plugin to create a beautiful datestring of my chosen format (for consistent VikingLog dates ;) witness: *Monday March 26 2018 8PM*)
